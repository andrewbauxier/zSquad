The issue with the "KAN" prefix appearing instead of your specified IDs ("T" for tasks and "S" for subtasks) is due to how Jira automatically generates issue keys based on the project's key (in this case, "KAN"). Jira assigns a unique identifier to each issue when it is created, and it doesn't allow you to manually set the issue keys during import.

Hereâ€™s a workaround that might help:

Use a Custom Field: Instead of trying to set the Key field (which Jira auto-generates), you could create a custom field (e.g., "Task ID") in Jira where you manually set the T and S IDs. You would then import this custom field with your data.

can you do the custom field please? T- for tasks and S- for subtasks
